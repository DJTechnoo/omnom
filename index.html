                    Our sushi is constructed with perfectly treated rice and seafood for an extraordinary rich flavour. Our sushi has been nominated the best in the world.

                    <h3>The secret</h3>
                    <p>For many years we've kept a secret which has never seen the public, until very recently.
                        The secret is simple, yet so very elegant - We grow our own rice in an extremely carefully monitored environment. The flavour on your plate is completely dependent on how we grow our rice.

                    <h3>Our way</h3>
                    <p>Our restaurant dates all the way back to 1883 and has been evolving and specialising in many fields 
                        such as brewery, steaming and cookery. One thing has always remained the same, and that is the technique
                    that has been used from the beginning to serve a perfectly crafted sushi on your plate.</p>

                    <p>
                        From the moment you set foot in our restaurant, you will immediately be greeted with a plate with sushi of your choosing ready to eat.
                        We stand out from other restaurants by having no waiting time at all. Our sushis are crafted before the order meets the light of day.
